# Experiment 4: DeFi Lending and Borrowing Protocol

## Date: 21.04.2025

# Aim:
To build a decentralized lending protocol where users can deposit assets to earn interest and borrow assets by providing collateral. This experiment introduces concepts like overcollateralization, liquidity pools, and interest accrual in DeFi.

# Algorithm:

### Step 1: 
Deploy contract and set the owner, interest rate, and liquidation threshold.

### Step 2: 
User deposits funds by calling deposit() and sending Ether to the contract.

### Step 3: 
Check collateral and ensure it meets the required threshold for borrowing.

### Step 4: 
User borrows funds by calling borrow(amount), transferring borrowed funds to the user.

### Step 5: 
Record deposits in the deposits mapping and borrowed amounts in the borrowed mapping.

### Step 6: 
Accumulate interest (future step, not implemented in current contract).

### Step 7: 
Check liquidation if the userâ€™s collateral is below 150% of the borrowed amount.

### Step 8: 
Liquidate borrower by calling liquidate() and transferring seized collateral to the caller.

# High-Level Overview:
Teaches key DeFi concepts: lending, borrowing, collateral, liquidation.


Introduces risk management: overcollateralization and liquidation.


Directly related to DeFi protocols like Aave and Compound.

# RESULT : 
Thus, a DeFi Lending and Borrowing Protocol has been successfully built and implenmented on Remix - Ethereum IDE
